There are 3 student processes and 1 teacher process. Students are supposed to do their assignments and they need 3 things for that-pen, paper and question paper. The teacher has an infinite supply of all the three things. One students has pen, another has paper and another has question paper. The teacher places two things on a shared table and the student having the third complementary thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion. The teacher then places another two things out of the three and again the student having the third thing makes the assignment and tells the teacher on completion. This cycle continues. WAP to synchronise the teacher and the students

Explanation:
1.	In the given solution I have taken all the resources as Boolean values and initialized then to 0.
2.	I have made 3 processes in three different functions.
3.	User will get a menu to select any two out of three resources.
4.	If one process is completed there will be a message printed on the screen saying process is completed.
5.	If the User always select the same options than the program will show and error if that process is already completed.
6.	After completion of all the three processes the program will end.
